Welding, and trades in general. I went to a vocational school(that had computer science and other shops like that), and was dreading going through the trades hall (Welding, HVAC, Automotive, Carpentry, Plumbing, etc.) I found all of them to be really fun and interesting, and could've seen myself doing one of them, except Electrical, I didn't like that, my fingers were like bleeding.The progressive neighborhoods of the city are Central West End, Tower Grove East, Tower Grove South, Shaw, and Forest Park Southeast.  Other than that the city is mainly moderate to conservative Democrats.  Outside of the city limits it's a mix of moderate Democrats and Republicans, but frankly a lot of them aren't really that much different.

In general, even with the Democrats here, most are very centrist.  You'll see a lot of the old-school blue-collar Democrats, but most aren't concerned with the issues raised by progressives.  Progressive politics are generally frowned upon as a whole in the area.
